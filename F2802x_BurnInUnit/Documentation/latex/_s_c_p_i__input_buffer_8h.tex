\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file provides the S\-C\-P\-I input buffer and the functions that are used to access and manage it

The input buffer stores D\-A\-Bs, G\-E\-T messages, and E\-N\-D messages. The input buffer then delivers these messages to the parser in the order that they were received from the I/\-O control.
