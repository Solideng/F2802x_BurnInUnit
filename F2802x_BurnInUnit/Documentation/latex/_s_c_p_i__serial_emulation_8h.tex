\subsection{Detailed Description}
This file provides functions to allow serial emulation of G\-P\-I\-B as specified by I\-E\-E\-E 1174-\/2000

Compliance with this standard is, however, dependent on R\-S-\/232 hardware connections as set out in I\-E\-E\-E 1174-\/2000 Class 1. As this library is intended for use in an embedded environment, with simpler serial protocols (such as I2\-C, S\-C\-I, S\-P\-I, etc) this emulation only follows the standard outside of this requirement nd so does not claim compliance.
